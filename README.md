## Local Manifest Helper

A git repository to place in the .repo/local_manifests directory for your ROM.

This simplifies projects needed (and their cherry picks if needed) for maintained devices across build machines.

To set up, clone the respective branch into .repo - then in the future instead of a repo sync, you will run the master update script instead.

Finally, basic scripts (or samples of - project specific can be found in the actual branch) to compile are also found in the master branch.  Clone to a temporary area once to copy the files to your path.
